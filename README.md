# Remind-Me

This was to be a simple remind me app which sends you notification via e-mail or phone but it didn't worked because of:

1. For this to work, this needs to run all the time
2. This will require me to buy a server 
3. Running this in front end was also not possible as push-notifications are't free.
4. I've tried and tested everything i could for this to work for free, but it wasn't possible till 2, apr, 2020.
